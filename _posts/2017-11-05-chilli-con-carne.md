	Love is a burning thing
	And it makes a fiery ring.
	Bound by wild desire
	I fell into a ring of fire.

Chilli con carne is another great stew variation. I like to serve this one with sticky sushi rice to make for a stodgy glupy warming and delicious winter tea. The marrow bone is not necessary, but kicks this over the edge with flavour and an extra smooth velvety texture. It is best to cook this at least one or two days in advance, as it gives the flavour time to mix through.

Obviously this lacks the traditional kidney beans, but we have found them to be a bit of a fodmap enemy. Feel free to add them yourself though, or if you have a good replacement. 

	2 tablespoons of onion oil
	2 teaspoons cumin
	1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
	1/2 teaspoon cayenne
	1/2 teaspoon chilli
	750 g mixed beef and pork mince (60:40)
	1 marrow bone
	1 litre beef stock
	1 can chopped tomatoes
	1 tablespoon tomato puree
	1 teaspoon brown sugar
	
 * Heat the onion oil over medium/high heat in a large saucepan.
 * Add in the meat and stir.
 * Add in the cumin, 1 teaspoon of salt and the various chilli powders.
 * Add in the stock, canned and puree tomatoes.
 * Add in the marrow bone and the sugar.
 * Bring the mixture to a simmer.
 * Transfer to an oven, preheated to 120 C.
 * Cook in the oven for an hour.
 * Add the marjoram.
 * Cook for a further 10 minutes.
 * Make sure the marrow is all out of the bone centre and mixed through the stew; remove the bone from the mixture.
 * Remove the stew from the pot and transfer to Tupperware.
 * Allow to sit in the fridge for at least one day to fully mix flavours.
